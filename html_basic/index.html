    <h2>About This Project</h2>
    <h3>Learning HTML Basics</h3>

    <!-- Paragraphs -->
    <p>This is my very first webpage created using HTML. It’s simple, but it marks the beginning of my web development journey.</p>
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and it is the foundation of all web pages. Without it, the web would not exist as we know it.</p>
    <p>In this project, I’m practicing how to structure a webpage using headings, paragraphs, and images.</p>
    <p>By the end of this exercise, I will have a better grasp of HTML syntax and how to create more advanced web pages in the future.</p>
